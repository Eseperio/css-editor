- [ ] Instead of color palett icon and floating button, for default use a fixed small dark bar on top with text "Press
  here to enter style editor", then, legend changes to "Click any element to edit its styles"
- [ ] Keep all css changes. All changes made to different elements should be kept in memory, so when user customizes a
  second element, the first one keeps its changes. And css generated includes all changes made to all elements.
